# RCOS_Workshop_10-3.github.io
Demo from Workshop on 10/3 for RCOS


Visit the <a href = "https://ll2025.github.io/RCOS_Workshop_10-3.github.io/">website</a> for navigation.

It includes a Home, About, and Other Page.
On the About Page, it explains what this website is for. The Other Page includes an external link and an image.
The CSS Elements put in this website were:
- making the links to the other pages into a navigation bar
- making it so when you hover over the navigation bar buttons, the text color changes to red and the block around that button is light grey color instead of the dark grey of the navigation bar itself.
- making it so there is extra spacing between the text on the pages to make it easier to read.
